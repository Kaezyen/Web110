    <h1> Practice Web Browser Safety</h1>
    1.) Checked Browser options for Google Chrome
        First we checked out Chromes privacy settings; The first option is to clear browsing history, cookies, cache and more (If you do advanced settings you can erase
        passwords and sign in data, recent downloads, etc) This is always something that I noticed could hurt me if I lost one of my devices since I use the same email 
        on all my devices a lot of my data is transferred between devices, such as my browsing history, and even saved passwords. Next we have the option to allow cookies 
        from third parties, block them or block all cookies which isnâ€™t recommended but still an option for 100% certainty you arent being tracked by any cookies. 
        Cookies are a way for google and other websites tell what you are browsing, or save data that may be used often if a user returns to the 
        website (Such as for reccomended searches) Next there are different levels of protection that you can use when on Chrome, I currently use Standard since I 
        do sometimes download files from weird sources and I do not want to deal with the warning message since I already know about the risk, but 
        enhanced protection helps with dangerous websites, downloads and extensions and also warns you about password breaches. You are also able to connect 
        to a different DNS server which can have a more secure connection, manage security keys with your phone, manage different certificates on your device. 
        Next a very important one is the Site settings/Site permissions, a lot of times websites ask for more access than they truly need, 
        I remember one time I was downloading a app on my phone and they wanted access to and ability to edit my contacts, phone, camera, gallery and a lot of other 
        personal apps on my phone which they did not need access to at all. This tab allows for you to change Location, Camera, Microphone, and many other settings 
        to either be enabled or disabled.

    2.) Checked that my browser was up to date- this ensures that I have all the security updates incase there was a breach in their code that they had to fix.
        <br>
        <br>
    3.) Checked all my add-ons are up to date
        <br>
        <br>
    4.) Uninstalled about 5 add-ons I am not sure why I had installed
        <br>
        <br>
    5.) Cleared my browser cache and cookies
        <br>
        <br>
    6.) Removed a lot of my personal information from google autofill
        <br>
        <br>
    7.) Tested incognito tabs
        <br>
        <br>
    

    <h2> Summary </h2>
      <p> This chapter taught us about keeping our personal information safe when browsing online, During the activity that I completed I learned everything
          I needed to know to keep my information private when using Google Chrome, which I am sure it is similar on most other browsers. From clearing my browsing data,
          clearing passwords, clearing out my autofill information as well as clearing cookies helps keep things private and keeps your browser up to speed and also clears
          up some RAM usage since Chrome is very well known for this problem. It also reminded me to check my add-ons and clear them out from time to time becuase I find
          myself installing a bunch of random ones, as well as multiple of the same kind of add-on to try finding the best one and always forget to uninstall them once
          I dont need them anymore.
