        <h1> Final Summary </h1>
        <p> Working through this last project helped me make sure I know what I was talking about so I could teach the correct material.
            Now that I know how to work with HTML/CSS and Javascript as well as working with Databases and SQL I want to start learning how
            to put everything all together so I can make a database interface for my website so I can keep stores updated consistantly as the database
            is edited through. I am going to go back and work on one of the websites I use to work on with a store and see if there is a way I can connect
            their store database with their store to automatically update items. Another thing I will be using from this class will be the different
            security things we learned, mainly with browsers and privacy settings and making sure I wipe my browsing history as well as my cookies every so often.
            As well as making sure my addons are actually needed and not just there taking up space
