    <h1> Part 1</h1>
        <h2> Send, Receieve and Respond to email</h2>
        <p> For this activity I created a Yahoo account since I have been using Gmail mostly in my life,
             One thing I noticed between Yahoo and Gmail is that sending a email is mostly the same, you have your 
             To field, Subject field and the body of the email. Emails all follow the same layout typically which makes it
             so much easier to swtich between different emailing services. One way I can use this in my life in the future is if 
             I work for a company that requires you to have a email on a certain site, which will still work mostly the same as 
             any other email service.
        </p>
        <h2> View email message headers</h2>
        <p> Im glad we learned about this topic. One thing I am always worried about when using email is clicking on an email that
             I thought was sent by someone, but in reality it was just a scammer getting my information. A few ways I was already
             keeping an eye out for were mis-spellings, and the information being asked (They will never ask for SSN or banking information)
             but with this lesson I learned about being able to trace an email with full headers. Im glad I still have my old email that got
             leaked so it is spammed constantly with scam emails. One for instance has "Get YourFreeMedicareQuotes 1996" for the subject and
             when I go to see the header of who sent it, it came from "Medicare Coverage <So_po.f9@icloud.com>" and was sent to the email
             joebiden@aol.com. How I got this email I have no idea, but looking at it we can easily tell its a scam, since for one, its not coming
             from a medicare email which would be @medicare.gov not icloud.com. It also redirects you to a link hosted off of Amazon AWS which goes to
             medicaresearcher.com. Nothing about this email seems legit at all.

    <h1> Part 2</h1>
        <h2> Activity 1 </h2>
        <p> Looking at the webpage of the various social media sites 3 of them gave me some interest, the first being Linkedin, going into CS for work
             usually requires alot of connections with everyone else in the field, linkedin provides this by helping you find like-talented people or businesses
             that are hiring, there is also messaging within the app. The second one was Flickr, I love changing my wallpaper a bunch, and I love photos of outerspace
             I wont be able to find that very easy using Facebook or Instagram, but on Flickr I will be able to find it without seeing things that are personailized to people
             such as status updates and stuff. The last website that interested me is Line, Long ago I remember using Bluestacks as a android emulator on my computer and 
             used Line on it so I can make phone calls straight from my computer, Im not sure if that still works but it is really useful for people that do not have phones
             since you are able to text, video, audio messages and also make free calls.

    <h1> Part 3</h1>
        <h2> Intellectual Property </h2>
        <p> Since there is so much copyrighted material online and a large amount of ways to share the content such as UTorrent (Any torrents for that matter are
             typically pirated). Your ISP can find out if you are getting material online for free and avoiding copyright laws. Reading the FAQs it appears that
             if they detect it once, they will warn you and tell you to stop engaging in that activity, otherwise if you continue and get caught again you can be sued
             by the person who copyrighted the material. I remember pirtating music was very big in my school mainly for the reason YouTube was blocked, many students would
             look up a YouTube video they wanted and download a MP4 copy of the video so they can watch it, other kids didn't want to watch the videos and would 
             rather download the songs from a video they would go to a Youtube to MP3 link which are all mostly shutdown now (At least the ones that were going around my school)
             Im very surprised nothing came from it, IE nobody got in trouble since almost everyone in that school was breaking copyright laws as stated in the resource "you 
             downloaded an app on your smartphone that allows you to 'strip' the audio from any YouTube music video and permanently keep that audio". Eventually the school did
             allow us to download Spotify and that was when most kids used Spotify instead, but a few used downloaders to get music that wasn't on Spotify. If you are caught for
             a second time you could face a felony record, up to 5 years in jail and fines up to $250,000. Even if you get away with it for awhile, they can always catch you, my
             younger self use to do this type of stuff alot until I learned about copyright, and all the consequences that can come along if you don't follow copyright law
