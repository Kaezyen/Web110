    <h1>IP Addresses and Geolocation</Address></h1>
      <p> 1.) Using "what is my IP" I was able to find my IPV4 address which is 73.8.***.*** which I was then able to put <br>
              into a IP Location finder and find where my IP address is coming from. I have used this in the past to mess with <br>
              some of my friends online but since IPs weren't designed to get a exact location you get a location nearby, which <br>
              in my case was Arlington Heights even though I am located in Des Plaines (Still pretty close)
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 2.) A few things I learned/ had a refresher on was that just using a basic IP address you can get close to a location <br>
              of where the address came from but you cannot find the exact computer it is coming from. However knowing somebodys IP <br>
              you can do more than geolocation, I remember reading awhile back that with IP addresses some people if they possess the skills <br>
              can use it to frame people for crimes by making acting like they are the owner of the IP and using it for malicious reasons.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 3.) In the future I plan on working in the cybersecurity sector and I am sure that IP tracing may be apart of that job if I end up <br>
              ever doing criminal investigation or intelligence which is something I have been thinking about. Currently I know I can use knowledge about IP <br>
              addresses to protect myself/household by masking it so people aren't as easily able to get into <br>

    <h2> Summary </h2>
      <p> This chapter taught us about HTML and the basics of the internet, including writing our own HTML, IP Addresses,Git/Github, and the history/governance of <br>
          the internet. The one thing I have not really learned yet about the internet is using Github effectively, alot of my CS classes have brushed over using <br>
          Github including creating an account and everything, but never actually used it for the class, I hope we are able to learn more about Github, considering <br>
          we will be turing our assignments in on there I am sure I will pick things up along the way which will be extremely important if I start working on huge <br>
          collaboration projects which require a main file system in place where everyone can download files from and push files to. Looking forward to using CSS and <br>
          Javascript as well, I worked a little with HTML (Hence why I did a little more than expected with the document, but wanted to make it look nice so I can come <br>
          back and read it, but im excited to learn styling with CSS and animations with Javascript!</p>
