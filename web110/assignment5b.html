    <h1>This Is My Summary for CSS</h1>
      <p style=" background-color: white; font-size: 15px; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">
            I was very excited with learning CSS, I am looking to continue working with this assignment and making it look better, but want to make 
            sure my baseline CSS is good. Now that I know how to change the looks of a website I feel much better when it comes to creating my own website. Here 
            in the next unit when we start learning Javascript,I can start adding animations and other things to the website as well. From being able to change what the
            text looks like, the size it is presented as, as well as make different things pop out such as the headers. I also had fun learning to put on a background image 
            as well as a background box that way my website can also have a image in the background instead of a plain white color.

    <h1> This is My Summary for HTML + CSS</h1>
      <p style=" background-color: white; font-size: 15px; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">
            Coming into this class I had basic knowledge on HTML and CSS but now I feel I can come into VS code and be able to make a decent looking website from scratch
            without using Wordpress or anything, although I do want to work with Wordpress now that I know CSS so I can make websites more unique instead of only using
            templates. I am planning on creating websites for random uses here soon just to pad up my resume, as well as maybe talk with my dad about redoing his website
            once more but this time without Wordpress and doing it the good ol fashion way of a ton of files, and alot of writing.
