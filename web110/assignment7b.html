    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p> During this lesson I was able to get a refresher on the basics of SQL, I am currently enrolled into a Database class which has gone over SQL and datebase
        creation so I already knew most of what was taught but it made it so I remembered the basics of SQL statements since we are not writing many SQL lines in that class.
        I did not know that you could link Databases with Websites and have it so they update automatically which is something pretty cool! I always wondered how big businesses
        like Amazon was able to always keep their website up to date with prices, quantity and who is selling it. One thing I would like to do is tie my Inventory to my website
        so I am able to do the same thing and show customers what parts I have availible, etc. once I get my repair/PC building business going.
