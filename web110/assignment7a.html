    <h1> Summary </h1>
    <p> With these activies I learned how to put in images and videos on my Website. During this I also learned that not every file type is supported by
        every web browser, I had always thought that MP4 was a safe way to go and that everyone will be able to view it but after this lesson I know I need to
        include files that are supported by most browsers, since I am sure there are a ton of different browsers out there that may be obscure and not support the
        video file types. I am going to be using this in the near future this winter break once I start setting up a computer repair business website, now I can use pictures
        and videos to captivate an audience more.
