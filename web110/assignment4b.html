        <h2> Summary HTML</h2>
        <p> Even though I already had a grasp on HTML before starting this unit since I wanted to learn it a long time ago I still learned a few things
        the first being using comments, I never thought about commenting HTML code since there really isn't too much to it but now that I know there is 
        a option to do so I will start doing it once my documents start becoming longer and longer to make them easier to read. I also really like the notes 
        that you prepared for us since all the information that we will need when writing HTML and I will definately be referencing it until I have it all
        memorized. I want to start making websites for people as well and this is a great start to doing so, I want to learn how to use HTML along with Python
        to write websites way easier as well.

        <h2> Summary Communication</h2>
        <!-- I Am not sure what communications summary is but I assumed it was the networking one so i copied and pasted this from assignment 4a-->
        <p> Working through these activities I found areas that I will be using in the future, I have friends that are in cybersecurity with Ford and working on
            this assignment I was asking them questions about different things that I was using and the hosts file is pretty important in their line of work sincet
            they want to make sure they are only connecting to one server when they are working on their things for Ford. The 1st activity I found very useful since
            it teaches you ways of being able to fix internet issues that you may never think of since mostly you are just told to unplug and replug in your router, or
            to restart your computer which alot of times doesn't work. When we are on the phone with our ISPs I have a feeling flushing DNS or renewing a IP certificate
            is a way that they fix things sincen in the past I had to use them before to fix connectivity issues. I forsee myself using almost everything I learned in <thead>
            networking section to do my job in the future doing cybersecurity.
