    <h1> Project Plan</h1>
    <p> For my Final project I would like to make a slideshow presentation over CSS. I would like to do HTML but since 
        HTML is pretty basic and easy to understand I want to dive deeper into topics of CSS that the class did not explicitly 
        go over in-depth, mostly relating to tags and different things you can do in CSS with different tricks to make your website 
        look more unique. I will also describe what makes a website nice to look at and what CSS tricks you should follow to keep users 
        attracted to the website. Within this Powerpoint presentation I want to include slides that explain the tags, screenshots of the 
        CSS and what it looks like on a HTML page as well as my voice explaining each slide more in-depth.
    </p>

    <h1> Project Management Summary</h1>
    <p>
        During this unit I learned how to control a project from the beggining to the end of a project. To start with figuring out the details that
        the stakeholders want, the costs that we need to stick to, and the timing of the project, as long as the people I would need to complete it.
    <br>
        The big thing that we learned during this unit was the project development cycle, which is like many other cycles when it comes to creating something
        but is still extremely imporant to know these are the following steps.
    </p>
    <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Initiating </li>
            <li> Planning </li>
            <li> Production/Execution </li>
            <li> Monitoring and Controlling </li>
            <li> Closing </li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        Using this knowledge we have a baseline of what each project needs to go through before we can come out with something successful. Throughout
        my time of browing random IT related forums I found myself always finding people saying it may not be a good idea to start working with a start up
        company that wants to pay with stock and salary since most of them end up failing, after reviewing the videos they said only about 1/3 of projects in 
        tech end up being completed and alot of it falls down to the project management, how the funds were allocated, how much time was wasted, etc. A good example
        of this is with the creators of DOOM and the arist who wrote the music for DOOM Eternal, alot of the sound tracks were messed up on the OST for the game and people
        were wondering what was going on, originally the company behind DOOM just blamed the artist but recently emails and screenshots came out that shows the poor planning
        on the part of the company. The arist said that he was not let in that they were making a soundtrack, and once he knew they were making a soundtrack he only head
        2 months time remaining until the game was suppose to launch, even after that the company behind DOOM failed to give him a contract in time, as well as not let him know 
        what songs he needs to master for the soundtrack and was simply told to master 12 songs for it, turns out the company didn't want the 12 songs he picked and asked him to
        restart with new songs. Without going more on this the original launch for the DOOM OST wasn't very good due to the poor communication of the project manager and this 
        music artist, as well as the timing the company used to release the game and simply did not give the artist enough time to do the soundtrack, and there was also issues
        with the artist getting paid in the end after all his work. Stepping back here we see that the project manager failed in a few areas
    </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Initiaing - Failed to find the scope of the project and did not know what was wanted</li>
            <li> Planning - Failed to let the proper people know what they need to work on - as well as having enough time to do so</li>
            <li> Execution - Follows with time restraint, still failed to produce a contract for the artist even with 2 months remaining for the project</li>
            <li> Controlling - Failed to ensure the project was moving along at a timely pace and was being done correctly and up to standards</li>
            <li> Closing - After it was all said and done, the company offered the artist $100,000 to keep quiet about the situation and released a soundtrack
                 that was NOT up to standards and many customers realized it when running it through audio software to see the wave forms.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <p>I would like to use this knowledge in the future when I am working on projects myself or if I ever find myself in a lead developer position.</p>
