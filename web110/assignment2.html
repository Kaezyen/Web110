        <h1> Session 1  </h1>
            <h2> Installing multiple web browsers to compare the different programs </h2>
            <p> (1) Brave Browser - I have not yet heard of this web browser but after playing with it
                                     a little bit I noticed some really nice things about it, first off it has a 
                                     built in ad-blocker which is wonderful for people that do not want to pay for
                                     YouTube premium or just do not want to deal with constant pop-up ads, unlike
                                     Chrome, FireFox and Edge where you have to manually install a ad-blocker to get one <br>
                                     Another thing that I like about it is when you are searching it brings up discussions
                                     which are mainly posts from Reddit which is a great way to review products in my opinion
                                     since there are so many different users on there. Another huge thing is being able to change
                                     the country you are searching from which is great for being able to see information that otherwise
                                     may be blocked or not availible in your country.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p> (2) Opera -  I have heard and seen this browser a bunch but never installed it myself. Its really nice to have a VPN
                              automatically once you install a browser without having to go in and manually install one. VPNs are useful
                              at hiding where your internet traffic is generating from to help hide yourself and your identity. Even though it
                              is a protected browser they were able to incorporate social media into the browser having a taskbar directly for Instagram,
                              Messenger or WhatsApp right off the bat, being able to install many more. They seem to just use google.com to search which doesn't 
                              do much for searching, its the same as using Chrome or FireFox (Depending on default search)
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p> (3) Chrome, FireFox - Im grouping these two together since my laptop uses FireFox and my desktop uses Chrome and they feel one in the same
                                       They both require manual installs for VPNs or Adblockers, the biggest difference I see between the two is the amount
                                       of resources they use on your computer with Chrome always being the leading user of my RAM and FireFox isn't too bad,
                                       which is why I use that on my laptop, since I dont have many resources to give out.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p> (4) Edge - Edge comes with any Windows install since it is the software that Microsoft launched with Windows (Formerly Internet Explorer)
                            I personally hate using Edge, it feels slow, Bing search engine is also very poor in my opinion, it feels over cluttered, always
                            suggesting related searches (Not only when im typing), then with edge alwys giving me random pop-ups it gets annoying after awhile.
                            I also tend to have a hard time to find information that I am looking for.
            </p>

            <h2> Compare browser HTML5 compatibility</h1>
            <p> Looking at the HTML5 Accessibility website we have a clear top 4, which would be Chrome 84, Edge 80, FireFox 80 and Safari 13 (Versions as of
                 August 2020) with Edge being 100% compatibile, Chome 98.5%, Safari 97% and FireFox which is 94%. First I want to explain why I belive there is a 
                 difference in the compatibility, we see that Edge and Safari are at very high scores, The reason I believe these teams followed standards so closely
                 is becuase they are the flagship browser for their respective operating sysyems (Edge being Windows and Safari being MacOS/iOS) Where as FireFox doesn't have
                 a parent company making phones/operating systems. Chrome on the other hand have Chromebooks, which are widely used in (mass computing?) - or Highschools or 
                 Offices that require alot of computers at a low price, which is the reason they are at a 98.5%, Im sure today these scores are much better, but I know IE11
                 has not changed at all.
            <br>
            <br>
                 Lastly the piece of coal in a field of gold is Internet Explorer 11, with a staggering score of 56%. The main reason for this was becuase of the age of the 
                 browser, it was built along time ago before HTML5 was a standard to follow, and many of the tags were added after support for IE11 -- Since Microsoft switched
                 over to Edge. 

            <h2> Summary </h1>
            <p> While working on these activities I learned of a few different browsers including Brave and Opera that I have not used before which both come with pretty nice 
                features, from Brave giving you a Adblocker right off the bat or Opera giving you a VPN off the bat, this makes setting up a new PC pretty simple since you don't
                have to search around for a -free- extension to use like you have to do in Chrome, FireFox and Edge. Another thing that I learned is that not all browsers are built
                the same - I did not know that some HTML5 features were not yet availible in every browser, the one thing that Chrome didn't have at the time the article was written
                was using the "meter" element which is pretty much a progress bar that fills up from a minimum to a maximum to indicate some data or loading. Another example would be
                Safari and FireFox struggling with controls, they are lacking Datetime-Local input, Month and week input and dialog elements (Which is a pop up box) Although I remember
                seeing these on FireFox so it has most likely updated since then. I foresee myself checking compatibility once I start creating websites and/or when HTML6 ever happens.

        <h1> Session 2</h1>
            <h2> Learn about Search engine Optimization</h1>
            <p> The website that I will be analyzing is a Website I created for my father about 3 years ago, which can be found here: https://bpicompanies.net/
                 When creating this website I knew of SEO but I did not know what it meant or how to do it effectively. Main things that I will be looking for will 
                 be, The wording used: Is it a word that someone will search up? Links: Do we link around our website/to other websites often, Do we have anybody linking to us?
                 Next will be content: Is there alot of graphical images/videos used? How about lists and paragraphs, we want our layout to be as user-friendly as possible.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
                <h3> Wording </h3>
                <p> We will only be analyzing the home page since this website has over 30 different pages that you can go to, When we first log into the page we 
                    are greeted with text that says "Your #1 Mechanical Contracting Business in Whiteside County" here I see some text that may not be helping us, mainly
                    the Mechanical Contracting part -- This business does everything from pool opening, foam insulation, plumbing and even HVAC so I asked my dad what I should
                    call his business, and to be fair, I dont think anyone is searching for a mechanical contracter when they need their pool opened, or when they have a clogged
                    pipe at home, they will be looking for "Pool Opening Near me" or "Plumber near me". One way I would fix this is by naming it a service buisness, since right
                    below the text I included a slideshow that shows everything that the company does. Scrolling down the page we have a who are we section which includes different
                    problems that can be solved, since sometimes people may be searching "Heating problems" or "Swimming Pool Issues", this part I would not change and if anything, try
                    putting more keywords in there for different issues relating to the same thing, (Such as Heating Problems, and Cooling Problems, both are HVAC)
                </p>
                <h3> Links </h3>
                <p> Throughout the page there are mulitple links that go around the page, in the header we have links to anything you need around the business, 
                     links to different forms, but unforunately we tried to keep the webpage entirely in-house and only link to a few outside pages for more information which
                     mainly occurs on the store so we can link to more information about a product. Other than the links inside the website there is only one other place that
                     I know of that links to the website and that would be the Facebook page that the business has. A way to fix this would be: Sharing the page often on Facebook,
                     Creating more social medias such as Twitter or YouTube.
             </p>
                <h3> Content </h3>
                <p> Just on the main page alone we have a map grapic to show where the business is located and a slideshow graphic. When looking at other websites for 
                     similar businesses I could throw in more pictures of work being done by them rather than having a page dedicated to the work they have done. I would
                     change how the lists are laid out, since there isnt too much information there using a image to display the different bullet points would look much
                     cleaner than just hvaing black text on a white background. 
                <h3> Updating</h3>
                <p> I have not touched this website in about 2 years, we use to do weekly updates but that fizzled out as we weren't a online buisness and just wanted to
                     have an online presence especially during the pandemic when we creating the online store so customers could do curbside pick-up. One thing that SEO needs
                     is constant updates on the website, new links to the website, and overall activity or we will slip to the bottom. Granted the business is located in a small town
                     so we weren't making the website to expand reach, rather allow current customers to stay at home to fill in pool opening forms, or ordering products.
                </p>
            <h2> Summary </h2>
            <p> I wish I took the time to learn about SEO when creating the website becuase now that I look back on it I could of done much better with it.
                 SEO helps with making your website seen on the search engine, what you want to achieve SEO is: Having good keywords (What will users be searching?),
                 Make the webpage easy to naviage, dont overload it with images or way too much text, Make sure you keepm upating your website with fresh links, and new
                 content otherwise the search engine may see your website as out of date and rank you lower. Most of all though is being able to have multiple other websites
                 link to your own website that way you are ranked higher on Search Engines and you also get traffic coming over from the website that linked you. This could
                 even be something on Facebook where someone shares your page (I see random PC pages posting links to articles all the time that they dont own to share with 
                 the world)
